I decided to implement this in Kotlin as a challenge. I don't think that Java and Kotlin are best-suited for this kind of problem, and runtime statistics at Kattis proves so.

`naive.kt` and `reverse.kt` is too slow to pass the tests. `graphlike.kt` passed the challenge with 0.86 seconds. Further optimizations might be possible.
